            <h3>About me</h3>
            <img src="../images/my-image.jpg" alt="my image" id=my-image >
            <p>I was born in China. I arrived in Ottawa on December 16<sup>th</sup>, 2022. I once was a handicraft shop owner and a part-time photographer. I love photography and traveling, and I love those moments that I traveled deep in nature, especially to places where people with different cultures and customs live, like Tibet and the highland in southwest China. My soul belongs to the wild. Apart from the time traveling, I prefer to stay alone, to read and find my inner peace.</p>
            <p>I want to be a freelance photographer in the future. Hope to record the diversity of human beings, as well as the people who fight for their freedom. </p>
            <p>I have never thought that one day I would learn anything about programming or stuff like this! I guess I would be a slow learner, but I'll try me best.</p>
