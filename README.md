Hi there, as a passionate UX designer and web developer, I hope to learn, grow and expand my horizons with developers around the world.

I was an editor, photographer, handicraft business owner, growth hacker, and now a UX/UI designer, graphic designer, and front-end developer. Feel free to reach out!
